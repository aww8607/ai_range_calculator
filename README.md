A Python program to calculate the distance between two hexes that accounts for physical obsticals
 
This script calculates the distance between each pair of hexes on a map, accounting for obstructions.

This map will allow the video game AI to navigate ships through chokepoints.

The hex_type.csv file contains the terrain type of each hex.

The adjacency function of the range_array_builder class will exclude hexes with impassible terrain types when determining adjacency

The program will output a .csv file with a two-dimensional array that shows the distance between each hex number.
